<h1 id="battleshipfront">BattleshipFront</h1>
<p>This project was generated with <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli">Angular CLI</a> version 7.3.8.</p>
<h2 id="development-server">Development server</h2>
<p>Run <code>ng serve</code> for a dev server. Navigate to <code>http://localhost:4200/</code>. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.</p>
<h2 id="angular-front-end">Angular Front-End</h2>
<p>The front-end was built in angular as it makes it easier and organized for bigger applications. Although Battleship is a small game, dividing various parts into components will make it easy to upgrade in future. There two components in this applicaton:</p>
<ol>
<li>BattleBoard, and</li>
<li>BattleBoard2</li>
<li>ScoreTable</li>
</ol>
<p>Both are the same design and almost same functions. They are the main web-app for player1, and player2. The game always works in pairs; when the first component is instantiated, it contains a link, which when clicked, instantiates the second component.</p>
<p>The application is built with a minimal design where the left part contains the player&#39;s board with her ship positions that were initialized randomly. Further, the right half contains an empty board through which the other player can be attacked by clicking a particular cell.</p>
<p>The applications initially requests a username, which is then used as a unique-id. If a user uses the same name in another instance, their win-count will be updated in the repository.</p>
<p>The third component displays the scorecard. It contains three columns displaying the user-name, the number of times they have lost the game and won the game. For a user to have their name in the score-card, they should have, at least once completed the game fully.</p>
<p>Further, the application has one service, <code>BattleService</code> that handles all the REST api calls. Websocket communications are handled by component themselves. The application uses <code>Routing</code> to toggle between different components in the application using pseudo URL&#39;s generated.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apart from the enemy&#39;s board, users can also see their own board and the ship positions. </li>
<li>The enemy attacks on a player&#39;s board are also marked. </li>
<li>If the enemy attacks correctly on a ship, a &quot;fire&quot; symbol appears in that positions.</li>
<li>A scorecard, as mentioned above, is also implemented.</li>
<li>Users can also see an error message if, for any reason, the websockets connection is lost with the server.</li>
</ul>
